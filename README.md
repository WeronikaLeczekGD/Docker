# Docker

1. ForkÂ GitHub - spring-projects/spring-petclinic: A sample Spring-based application

2. [Create Dockerfile for Spring-petclinic application using pre-built artifact](#ad-2)

- Build application outside of container

- Copy artifact from target folder into image and make it work inside container

3. [Create multi-stage Dockerfile for Spring-petclinic application](#ad-3)

- Application should be built as part of first stage

- Final image should contain only required files and based on minimal possible base image

4. [Create docker-compose configuration that will automatically start multiple containers](#ad-4)

- Run two containers: application + DB

- Provide credentials as environment variables, so DB image can be configured with custom credentials and application can connect to DB automatically

## Ad 2

To build application outside of container I used ```gradlew build```

After building application outside of container I copied artifact from target folder into image and made it work inside container. So my Dockerfile looks like this:

My Dockerfile:

To start contariner I used ```docker-compose up``` 

Then I added a user to database to check if it is working correctly after restarting. To check it I tried to find my user in database and he was there:
